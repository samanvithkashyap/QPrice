# QPrice

A team project exploring the use of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) for options pricing, originally built for the **Qiskit Fall Fest 2025**.

## The Core Idea

This project was our team's submission for the "Quantum Option Pricing" challenge. The prompt was:

> **Problem Statement:** Option pricing is an important problem in finance. The goal of this prompt is to explore how quantum circuits can be used to price options either using a quantum random walk or a **quantum machine learning (QML) model**.

`QPrice` is our exploration of that second track: an attempt to build a working QML model for pricing options.

The entire experiment is contained within the `QPrice.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. It trains a Variational Quantum Regressor (VQR) and compares its performance against a classical Random Forest model on the same dataset.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using the following core libraries:
* **Qiskit:** For building and simulating the VQR model.
* **Scikit-learn:** For data preprocessing and training the classical Random Forest model.
* **yfinance:** For downloading SPY options data.
* **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation.
* **Matplotlib:** For plotting the results.
 
## How to Run

The easiest way to run this project and see the results for yourself is to open it directly in Google Colab.

## Results

The VQR model was trained and evaluated alongside a classical Random Forest (RF) model on the same data for comparison.

### Key Metrics (Test Set)

| Model | R² Score | MAE |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **VQR (Quantum)** | 0.6292 | $40.21 |
| **Random Forest (Classical)** | **0.9865** | **$6.25** |

### Results Analysis & Inference

This comparison is the core finding of our project.

* **Classical Benchmark:** The Random Forest model achieved a very high $R^2$ score of **0.9865**. This is expected, as it's a powerful, mature algorithm well-suited for this kind of non-linear, tabular data. It serves as our "best-in-class" classical baseline.

* **Quantum Model:** Our VQR model achieved an $R^2$ of **0.629**. While this is numerically lower than the Random Forest, this result is highly encouraging. It successfully demonstrates that a quantum circuit, even one with only 3 qubits, can learn the complex, non-linear relationships in financial options data.

* **Conclusion:** The goal of the hackathon was to produce a *working* QML model. Our project confirms the **viability of the QML approach** as a proof-of-concept. The significant performance gap with the classical model is expected and highlights a key area of QML research: finding problems and model architectures where simple quantum circuits can be competitive with (or eventually outperform) highly optimized classical ones.

### Context Within QML Research

This project serves as a practical exploration of several open problems in the field of Quantum Machine Learning:

* **Finding Practical Applications:** We directly address the high-priority challenge of finding "real-life, practical problems" for QML by applying our model to the complex, real-world task of options pricing.

* **Benchmarking QML Algorithms:** The question "How can we benchmark QML algorithms?" is a major one. Our project answers this directly. By comparing the VQR (R²: 0.629) against a powerful classical Random Forest (R²: 0.9865), we provide a clear performance benchmark for this specific task and model architecture.

* **Encountering Barren Plateaus:** Our VQR's flat training convergence plot is a textbook example of the **"Barren Plateau"** problem. It demonstrates this major research hurdle in a practical setting, showing the difficulty of optimizing variational quantum circuits.

## Project Status

This was a team research project submitted for the Qiskit Fall Fest. The model and findings are experimental and reflect the work done during that event. It's intended to serve as a proof-of-concept and a learning exercise.

### Future Work

Given more time, we would have loved to explore:
* **Different Ansatzes:** Trying more complex ansatz (circuit) designs for the VQR to potentially mitigate the barren plateau problem.
* **More Features:** Adding other features like the risk-free interest rate or different volatility measures.
* **Other QML Models:** Comparing the VQR against other models like a Quantum-enhanced SVM.
